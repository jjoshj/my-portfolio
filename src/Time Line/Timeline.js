            <p><b>Date of Birth</b>:18.10.1998</p>
          <p>I'm a full stack developer from Chennai living in Cuddalore, TamilNadu. 
            I'm always looking for an opportunity to code and learn new things.
            I study everyday to learn something new with programming. 
            I like to code everything I imagine and I think it can make a social impact sometimes.</p>
            <p>I was born and brought up in Cuddalore and also completed my schooling there.  
               I joined Loyola college in Chennai for my bachelor'sÂ degree in mathematics. 
               I completed my M.sc at Loyola in the month of July this year.
               Then I joined Guvi to become a javascript full stack developer.
               I love playing football and have represented my hostel team in many competitions. 
               I am a smart hardworker and easily adaptable to any kind of environment, I see myself as a team player.
I would love to work in a company where I can contribute the organisation as well as develop my skills.</p>
